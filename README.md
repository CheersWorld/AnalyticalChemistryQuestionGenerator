# AnalyticalChemistryQuestionGenerator

Hello!

This is a practice-program designed to generate random values and provide solutions to compare your results with. 

This is not an ongoing project and bugs might never be fixed. This is in no way feature-complete, however new features might never happen due to time constraints. 

The application is supposed to display a question on startup, which it however doesn't in the .exe available in GitHub. It does on my Machine and I can't reproduce the bug locally. The code is there, you can see for yourself in "ViewModels\QuestionViewModel.cs" in Line 87

This project is not compatible with Mac, and I have no idea about Windows-compatibility apart from Windows 10. 

Feel free to use code in here wherever you want
