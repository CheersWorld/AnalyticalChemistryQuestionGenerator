# AnalyticalChemistryQuestionGenerator

Hello!

This is a practice-program designed to generate random values and provide solutions to compare your results with. 

This is not an ongoing project and bugs might never be fixed. This is in no way feature-complete, however new features might never happen due to time constraints. 

This project is not compatible with Mac, and I have no idea about Windows-compatibility apart from Windows 10. 

Feel free to use code in here wherever you want
